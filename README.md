<h1>a Certificates generator.</h1>
what it does basically you import an excel sheet with a bunch of names and hit the download button and it will download a zip archive containing the certificates for each name. 

i have put a certificate sample, but you can change it of course.

<b>important note!:</b> the names in the excel sheet must be all in one row.
